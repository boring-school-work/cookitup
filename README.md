# Recipe Sharing Platform

This is mainly a group project for a web technologies course.

## Context

We are to create a website solution to serve the needs of a specific group of people.
We settled on creating a recipe sharing platform called **cookitup**.

## Description

The Recipe Sharing Platform is for cooking enthusiasts, food bloggers, and those
passionate about discovering new recipes. This virtual community allows users to
share, explore, and engage with diverse culinary creations. The platform aims to
enhance the cooking experience by fostering a collaborative environment where
users can showcase their favourite recipes and connect with others who share
their love for food.

## Running The Project

### Dependencies

- Nodejs (to run tailwind css).
- xampp (to run the php server & mysql server).

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository in your htdocs folder.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm i` to install tailwind.
4. Start the tailwind development build by running `npm run dev` in the terminal.
5. Visit `http://localhost/cookitup` in your browser.

#### File Permissions

For file upload to work, you need to give the `assets/uploads` folder write permissions.

```console
chmod a+w assets/uploads
```
