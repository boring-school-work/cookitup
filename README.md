# Recipe Sharing Platform

This is mainly a group project for a web technologies course.

## Context

We are to create a website solution to serve the needs of a specific group of people. We settled on creating a recipe sharing platform called **cookitup**.

## Description

The Recipe Sharing Platform is for cooking enthusiasts, food bloggers, and those passionate about discovering new recipes. This virtual community allows users to share, explore, and engage with diverse culinary creations. The platform aims to enhance the cooking experience by fostering a collaborative environment where users can showcase their favourite recipes and connect with others who share their love for food.
